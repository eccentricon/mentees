## Ted's resources for mentees

Books and online resources to help you get started "drinking from the firehose"! I'll try to favor free resources here, and will note with "$" when they cost something. Check back here often, as I'll be updating this list as I recall or rediscover useful resources I think can help you. If there's something you'd like to learn more about, or a link you think would benefit others, please let me know.

### General topics

General resources not specific to any language.

#### Source control

* [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub [book]\
A good and thorough intro to Git (source code control) by the founder of GitHub. Free online book.

#### Time management

* [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) by Paul Graham [blog post]\
Influential blog post on managing your time as a developer (maker). Takeaway: Try scheduling blocks of time on your calendar for focused, uninterrupted development ("maker time").

#### Computing and programming

* [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/) by Joel Spolsky [blog post]

* [devdocs.io](http://devdocs.io) [website]\
DevDocs combines API documentation from multiple sources into a single, organized, and searchable interface.

#### Writing

Love to write, hate to write… There's no escaping it: email, requirements, design specs, code comments, user guides - it's all part of programming life. You'll write way more prose than code. And a software engineer who can write well has a super-power over colleagues who cannot (read "more valuable to employers").

* [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/) [website]\
Keep this writing reference handy; it'll dig you out of many writing dilemmas.

* [Technical Writing Courses for Engineers](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) [website]\
Google's free, short, self-study writing courses for engineers (Technical Writing One, Technical Writing Two, and [more]([url](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview))).

### HTML & CSS

* [MDN - Web technology references](https://source.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/engedu/languages/cpp/cpp201/) [website]\
Reference docs from the Mozilla Developer Network (Mozilla is the not-for-profit behind the Firefox browser), the [HTML reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) are really great - most web developers depend on these. Look up individual HTML tags or CSS properties and selectors here (left pane).

* [Web Development Course Resources List](https://appbrewery.com/p/web-development-course-resources) [website]\
Resource list supporting [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy ($[^dontpay]).

[^dontpay]: Don't pay a hundred dollars or more for Udemy courses; they go on sale all the time. I usually spend $15-25 for apiece for these courses. You may need to register on the site to get the deals - some of the courses themselves are quite good.

* [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) [website]\
Tutorials and reference lists I've been using for years, mostly:
  - [HTML element reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
  - [CSS reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp)
  - [CSS selector reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

### Java

* [The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) [website]\
Old, but still very effective and applicable.

* [OpenJDK documentation](https://devdocs.io/openjdk/) [website]\
Javadocs on the SDK libraries from OpenJDK's open source Java implementation.

* [JDK API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html) [website]\
Javadocs on the SDK libraries from Oracle's commercial distribution.

### JavaScript

* [MDN - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) [website]\
Authoritative reference on the language with excellent tutorials, from the Mozilla Developer Network.

* [_Eloquent JavaScript_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke [book]\
Highly praised by many experts, freely available online.

* [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) [YouTube channel]\
Nice YT tutorial on JavaScript, and other frameworks.

### Markdown

* [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) [website]\
Website of Markdown inventor John Gruber. Contains basics and syntax that will work in most Markdown servers, plus gives the general gist behind Markdown. Also check out the [Dingus](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) page where you can experiment with MD right in your browser.

* [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) [website]\

See also [_Writing_](#writing) above.

### Python

* [_Tiny Python Projects_](https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects) by Ken Youens-Clark [book, $]\
Currently my favorite intro-to-Python book. A series of fun test-driven projects, with accompanying YouTube videos if you want them.

Flask is an extremely popular framework for creating Python-driven websites and web applications.
